		0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
Requirements:
	Python Scripts:
All files are executable
The length of files tested using wc
All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (ver    sion 3.8.5)
The first line of all files are exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
The codes use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

	Shell Scripts:
All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
All scripts are exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2).
The first line of all files are exactly #!/bin/bash.
All files are executable.

	C Scripts:
All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Global variables are not used.
Codes are checked using Betty syle.
All prototypes are included in lists.h header file.

		Tasks
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
1. The last digit - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off - The program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. Hexadecimal printing - The program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
5. 00...99 - The program prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need - The program  prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. islower - The program checks for lowercase character.
8. To uppercase - The program prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important - a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. a + b -  a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. a ^ b - a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Fizz Buzz - a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13. Insert in sorted linked list - a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
